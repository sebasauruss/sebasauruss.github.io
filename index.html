      <p>If I were to describe Keziah in one sentence, I'd say she's like a breath of fresh air—just the thought of them can make you smile even when you're doing nothing.</p>
      <p>I know I haven't been with them personally, but I do know that she can make the people around them laugh—because that's exactly what she's been doing to me.</p>
      <p>She's funny, kind, cute, smart, pretty, caring, loyal, beautiful, and mean to me in a good way.</p>

Dear Keziah,                                                       

I just want to say—you’re honestly the most caring person I’ve ever met. I love how you are with me, with your friends, and with your sister. Just from your stories alone, I know you deserve someone who’s soft and gentle with you… and I want you to know that I’ll always be that person.
I love your smile.
I love your laugh.
I love your personality.
I love your endless kwentos.
And yes, even when you’re “mean” to me—I still love it, Because I know that’s your way of showing you care.

From the person you claim to hate with your whole heart, 
Seb.

Dear Keziah,                                                      
      
When I met you, I wasn’t looking for love—just someone to have fun with. But I’m so grateful that what we had turned into something more. We started liking each other, saying “I love you,” making each other laugh, and bringing smiles to each other’s faces.

I never thought I’d find someone as weird and freaky as me—and honestly, that makes me incredibly happy.

It might take months, maybe even years, before we can finally be together in person. But I know it’ll be worth every second—because it’s you. I may not be able to be there physically right now, but please know that I’m always here... just one call away.  

From your favorite kupal, 
Seb.

Dear Keziah,
      
I want you to know that there’s no one else I want to be with, talk to, call, play with, or imagine my future with. And most of all, there’s no one else I’d rather annoy and make suyo to every single day. I can’t imagine a future without you by my side—crying, smiling, or laughing. Your voice is the one I want to hear every single day.
      
When I saw the dates in the story you made to introduce me, I knew right away—19 was the perfect day to say yes.
      
05.19.25 – the day I messaged you
06.19.25 – the day you asked me if I liked you
07.19.25 – the day I’m proud to say that
<i>Keziah De Guzman</i> is my girlfriend.

I remember when you told me that you seek validation from others about whether you're pretty or not when you go out. I want to change that mindset of yours—just like how you helped me change my mindset about letting people care.

You're very beautiful, inside and out. You have this incredibly attractive smile that always gets to me and somehow always manages to leave me in awe. Do you know how much I love hearing you laugh? Because every time you do, I can feel you smiling. I might not see it, but i’m contented at the thought of u smiling.

And I hope you know that u being pretty isn't just about the physical. It's also about your heart, your mindset, how you think things through, and how you help the people around you—just like how you're helping your kuya. I find everything you do beautiful. every compliment I gave you wasn’t just to make you feel good—they’re all true, and I meant every one of them.

You deserve all the love, kindness, and good things in this world. And for you, I'll never stop trying to give it all.

Malas nila, wala silang Keziah na meron ako. At hinding-hindi kita ipapatalo.

ang ganda mo pag kagising, 
ang ganda ng pilikmata mo, 
ang ganda ng mata mo.

I don’t mind waking up first just to call and see you as you wake up. I could stare at you all day and never get tired. I really, really, really love looking at you—even when you’re not doing anything.

And one more thing—I love the way your eyes and cheeks form when you smile, instant tiklop talaga. I hope you know how much your smile means to me. I love teasing you in a good way because it makes me see that precious smile. Please don’t stop smiling, and if you do, I’ll make sure it comes back.

YOU are the best part of my mornings, keziah ko.

For someone who’s been independent, doesn’t like to show emotions, and finds it hard to cry, I found myself letting my walls down when I’m with you. I can depend on you without feeling like a burden because you never make me feel like one. It really surprised me how easily my tears fell when I left. Maybe it’s because, after being used to not needing anyone, this is the first time I can truly say there’s a person that I need — and it’s you, Keziah ko.

I need you, I want you, I love you. The peace I’ve always been searching for, I found it by being with you. No matter what misunderstandings we may have, I’ll always find comfort in your voice and presence.

Those three days and two nights that I spent with you is very special to me. I loved being able to hug you, kiss you, walk with you, and spend my mornings and nights with you.

Lastly, I hope you know how much I appreciate you — from the moment we met, you cared for me even without knowing me that well. That alone shows what kind of person you are — a person who is beautiful inside and out.

From your girlfriend,
Seb

Happy motmot, mahal ko.

Seven months ago simula nung nakilala kita, sobrang saya at napaka-swerte ko na meron akong ikaw. yes, five months pa lang tayo, pero counted na ’yung dalawang buwan kasi thankful na ako noon na may nakilala akong tulad mo. I don’t think na may mahahanap pa akong kakanta ng you’ll be in my heart ng 9:48 PM at magpapakilala na sya si niki, o kakausapin pa rin ako kahit bwisit na bwisit na sa kakupalan ko. Maybe hindi lang kita kinukupal noon dahil ganon ako, but because gusto ko ng pansin mo. Nabubuo araw ko tuwing nasa akin ang attention mo.

Naalala ko nung sinend mo sa’kin ’yung account mo na puno ng mga sulat mo. Sobrang na-amaze ako sa’yo noon na kahit hindi pa tayo ganon katagal magkakilala, gusto ko na ring magawan mo ako. dahil ang ganda ng way mo sa pag-deliver ng bawat linya.

Alam mo ba, tuwing saan man ako mapunta at may nakikita akong mga bulaklak sa daan, I’m always hoping to find kalachuchi. Naalala ko kasi sabi mo kahit petal lang, gusto mo—“naka-preserve pa yan” Kaya gusto kong makapitas para maibigay sa’yo.

Para kang kalachuchi—mahirap hanapin, pero once na mahanap na, I bet kung sino man makahanap, they’ll feel lucky. Because that’s how I feel. You are my kalachuchi, and I’m very lucky to have found you.
