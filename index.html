      <p>If I were to describe Keziah in one sentence, I'd say she's like a breath of fresh air—just the thought of them can make you smile even when you're doing nothing.</p>
      <p>I know I haven't been with them personally, but I do know that she can make the people around them laugh—because that's exactly what she's been doing to me.</p>
      <p>She's funny, kind, cute, smart, pretty, caring, loyal, beautiful, and mean to me in a good way.</p>

Dear Keziah,                                                       

I just want to say—you’re honestly the most caring person I’ve ever met. I love how you are with me, with your friends, and with your sister. Just from your stories alone, I know you deserve someone who’s soft and gentle with you… and I want you to know that I’ll always be that person.
I love your smile.
I love your laugh.
I love your personality.
I love your endless kwentos.
And yes, even when you’re “mean” to me—I still love it, Because I know that’s your way of showing you care.

From the person you claim to hate with your whole heart, 
Seb.

Dear Keziah,                                                      
      
When I met you, I wasn’t looking for love—just someone to have fun with. But I’m so grateful that what we had turned into something more. We started liking each other, saying “I love you,” making each other laugh, and bringing smiles to each other’s faces.

I never thought I’d find someone as weird and freaky as me—and honestly, that makes me incredibly happy.

It might take months, maybe even years, before we can finally be together in person. But I know it’ll be worth every second—because it’s you. I may not be able to be there physically right now, but please know that I’m always here... just one call away.  

From your favorite kupal, 
Seb.

Dear Keziah,
      
I want you to know that there’s no one else I want to be with, talk to, call, play with, or imagine my future with. And most of all, there’s no one else I’d rather annoy and make suyo to every single day. I can’t imagine a future without you by my side—crying, smiling, or laughing. Your voice is the one I want to hear every single day.
      
When I saw the dates in the story you made to introduce me, I knew right away—19 was the perfect day to say yes.
      
05.19.25 – the day I messaged you
06.19.25 – the day you asked me if I liked you
07.19.25 – the day I’m proud to say that
<i>Keziah De Guzman</i> is my girlfriend.
      
From your girlfriend,
Seb
